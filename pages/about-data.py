Data Source: X Community Notes, 2021-2025, available to public at: https://x.com/i/communitynotes/download-data <br>

 ### Introduction
Community Notes, formerly known as Birdwatch since the program’s inception on 1/28/21, is a crowd-sourced content moderation feature on X (formerly Twitter) that allows users to add context and fact-checks to potentially misleading posts [1]. Launched in 2021, this system employs a unique bridging-based algorithm that prioritizes agreement between contributors with diverse perspectives, rather than relying on majority rule [2]. By May 2024, the program had more than 500 thousand contributors, with notes being viewed billions of times [3]. The feature has been applied to a wide range of content, including posts by government accounts, politicians, and even X's owner, Elon Musk [4]. 

While Community Notes has shown promise in combating misinformation, with a study finding COVID-19 vaccine notes to be accurate 96% of the time [5], it has also faced criticism for potential vulnerabilities to manipulation and inconsistent application. Despite these challenges, the open-source nature of the algorithm and the transparency of the data have made Community Notes an intriguing subject for researchers studying bias, misinformation diffusion, and the effectiveness of collaborative fact-checking systems [6,7,8].
Understanding the main themes and narratives within large-scale textual data is crucial for gaining insights into public discourse and dynamics. 

            
### Preprocessing for this data:
The data has been preprocessed to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis. The following steps were taken: <br>
    1. Convert to lowercase <br>
    2. Standardize accent characters (ä → ae, ö → oe, ü → ue, ß → ss) <br>
    3. Remove URLs <br>
    4. Expand contractions (e.g., "am" → "an dem", "ins" → "in das") <br>
    5. Remove mentions (@) and hashtags (#) <br>
    6. Keep only alphabetic characters (optionally preserve hyphens in compound words) <br>
    7. Remove stopwords and very short words (2 letters and less) <br>
    8. Lemmatization using a German-specific lemmatizer <br>
